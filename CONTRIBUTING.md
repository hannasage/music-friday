## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Music Friday Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kevinhaube/music-friday/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to the maintainers.


## I Have a Question

Great! First, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/kevinhaube/music-friday/issues) that might be related to the question you have. If questions get asked enough, we will add it to the [FAQ](https://github.com/kevinhaube/music-friday#faq) section of our README. If no prior issues or FAQs address your question, you can write up a new Issue using one of our provided templates! We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

When contributing to this project, it is implied that your contribution may be provided under the project license. You can find this license on the home page of our repository, in the right-hand column.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report is easily replicable so engineers can assess and solve the issue at hand. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete as many of the Bug Issue template as you can to aid us in fixing the bug as fast as possible.

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to not-an-email@test.com.

Once you file a bug:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Music Friday, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/kevinhaube/music-friday/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kevinhaube/music-friday/issues). 

- **Utilize one of our Issue templates** rather than starting from scratch, as it provides the best starting point to outline your enhancements.
- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide as much detail as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Music Friday users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
